Core programming foundations and problem-solving experiments

This repository documents my progress in programming fundamentals, algorithmic problem solving, and applied experiments.

The goal is to develop strong computational thinking skills through deliberate practice, reflection, and iterative projects, with a long-term interest in applied computing and AI.
